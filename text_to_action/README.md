# Text to Action

Text to Action is an architecture designed to process and execute actions dynamically based on the given textinput. It tries understand the context and requirements of the input, and then directs it to the appropriate action.

## Step-by-step:

- Analyze input text: Interprets and deciphers the input to determine possible actions to be taken.
- Extract parameters: Extract all possible parameters (entity_models) from the input.
- Dispatch and Execute: Executes the actions that meet the threshold value with appropriate parameters.
